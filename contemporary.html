    <h1>Today’s Photography </h1>
    <div id="content"><p>
        Give the digital camera revolution about ten or fifteen years to stew and 
        now we find ourselves landed here in the present. We trudge knee-deep through 
        swamps of the newest cameras and lenses and any other piece of gear we can 
        dream into reality. Imagine the reaction of Niepce if he saw the ease by which 
        photographs are now taken instantly on the street. No more bulky camera obscuras. 
        Without plates or film or chemicals. Just press the button.

        The Digital Age
        Does this ease of production outway the quality of production? Without a doubt, 
        the majority of those 800+ trillion photos we made last year will not be pieces 
        of treasured art or make their way onto the walls of the finest cafe in Paris. At 
        the same time, however, they do fulfill the most basic and primordial purpose of 
        photography. Those pictures preserve a memory. It might not be a far-reaching 
        preservation, but it is preservation nonetheless. This fixing of memory has the 
        potential to give us a measure of happiness within ourselves that is no less satisfying 
        than that felt by the first picture takers over two centuries ago. The difference 
        between us and them, is that we have perhaps become numbed by the very magic they 
        helped to create.

    <h1>The Next Evolutionary Phase </h1>
    <div id="content"><p>
        The next evolutionary phase of photography might not be a progression in the way 
        we make images. Instead, it’s quite possible the next unseen horizon will come from 
        the way we share those images with the world or how we store them for ourselves. If 
        a photograph indeed captures a memory, what use is that memory unless it can more 
        tangibly recalled. Looking back in the history of photography has each subsequent 
        advancement not strived to make the photo more qualitative, more lasting, and more real?
