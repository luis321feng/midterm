    <h1>The History of Photography</h1>
    
    <div id="content"><p>
        Fast forward about 2,200 years. It is around 1826 and we find ourselves 
        back with Joseph Nicephore Niepce. He is looking out his window and he 
        is about to make a photograph… well, a heliograph, to be exact.
        
        This was around the time Niepce produced what is believed to be the 
        oldest surviving photograph from a window of his estate located in Le Gras 
        in the Burgundy region of France. What Mr. Niepce concocted was a small 
        piece of polished pewter which he then coated with a solution of bitumen 
        and lavender oil. Bitumen is a naturally occurring asphalt and is sometimes 
        referred to as Bitumen of Judea. The most interesting property of bitumen 
        is that it is light sensitive.
        
        So, for what has been speculated from anywhere between eight hours to 
        several days, the piece of polished pewter with bitumen emulsion remained 
        in Joe’s camera obscura. What resulted was this:

    <h1>Daguerre's contributtion</h1>
    <div id="content"><p>
        Shortly thereafter, Niepce partnered with a Parisian artist named Louis Daguerre 
        and began further investigations and refinements into Niepce’s process. Sadly, 
        Niepce passed away in 1833 but luckily left his notes entirely to Daguerre who 
        continued working. Louis favored a silver-based processes and used plates with 
        silver coatings which were exposed to iodine fumes. The iodine reacted with 
        the silver and produced a coating of photosensitive silver iodide on the plates.
        
        The major innovation of Daguerre’s process was the discovery that by applying mercury 
        fumes to the exposed silver plate he could actually make the “latent” image visible 
        on the plate thus reducing the lengthy exposure times of previous methods. Now, 
        exposures could be measured in minutes instead of days. Daguerre’s method of silver 
        iodide emulsed plates developed with mercury vapor was called… you guessed it… the 
        Daguerreotype. These instructions were then published as a free gift to the world on 
        August 19th, 1839.
